NOTE*** this repo only has the front-end code for the website, the back end is omitted for security reasons, however it is built with node.js and connects with firebase to add user authenication to the app

## Inspiration
I came to this hackathon with the sole purpose of learning more about front-end development. I have been avoiding learning front-end Javascript frameworks, so I promised to learn them this weekend. I found that no challenges really cared about the user interface so I decided to try my best to create the most useless hack, with the most maximally complicated method I could think of.
## What it does
The project does absolutely **bold**nothing**bold**. I built a full-stack web application that allows users to register their emails and authenticate their login so that they may have even more access to the useless features on the website.
## How we built it
I used React, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Node.js, Express, Firebase, and MongoDB, and hosted it locally for demoing.
## Challenges we ran into
I knew absolutely zero about Javascript prior to this hackathon, so I spent a very long time actually learning enough to put everything together.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I learned a ton during this hackathon and I'm really proud that I was able to create something functioning with so little prior knowledge.
## What we learned
I learned a ton about front-end development, essentially all my knowledge of javascript was learned during this weekend.
## What's next for World's most useful website
Create something actually useful. I have a great skeleton for something that could be great, so maybe in another hackathon, I could build off of this project.

##How I made it

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
